Building machine learning algorithms from the ground up in Python using Numpy.

This is an ongoing project and I will be implementing the following learning algorithms:

Linear Regression 
Logistic Regression 
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ✅
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Decision Trees 
Random Forests
Naive Bayes 
K-Means
Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)
Perceptron
Neural Network
