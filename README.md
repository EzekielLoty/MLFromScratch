Building machine learning algorithms from the ground up in Python using Numpy.

This is an ongoing project and I will be implementing the following learning algorithms:

Linear Regression  
Logistic Regression  
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) ✅  
Naive Bayes  
Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  
Decision Trees  
Random Forests  
K-Means  
Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM)  
Perceptron  
Neural Network
